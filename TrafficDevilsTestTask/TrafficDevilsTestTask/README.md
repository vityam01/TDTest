#                                         MAIN TASK:

Create a game using SpriteKit. The game screen contains a start button. Button disappears after pressing it and the ball begins to fall, on its way down there will be platforms that occupy the width of the screen to the extent that the ball can pass to the right or to the left to continue its fall. The ball's movement to the right and left is controlled by the accelerometer.
Everything except the ball moves upward at a speed 25 slower than the speed at which the ball falls.

A loss occurs if the ball stays on the platform and reaches the top of the screen for the conditions, if the time spent in the game is less than 30 seconds. 
If time spent in the game is greater than or equal to 30 seconds, then the game is won.

Game over screen is a full screen web view. Winner and loser got different urls to load in the webview. To get urls for winner and loser use this link : “https://2llctw8ia5.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod”

#                                           DETAILS: 

-It is advisable not to use third-party libraries
-The design can be very simple
-Links from this link should not be written in the middle of the code but will be obtained when the application is first launched
- Don’t forget about navigation back to game screen
- Provide link to github as a result
